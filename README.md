# Pokédex: a PokeAPI Pokémon List Filter

This repository showcases an application that utilizes the PokeAPI to list the initial 151 Pokémon, allowing users to filter them by type through a customizable button panel. The project is inspired by the freeCodeCamp exercise but is enhanced with personalized styles and images, reflecting a unique design approach.

## Features

- **PokeAPI Integration:** Utilizing the PokeAPI as the primary data source to fetch and display information about the initial 151 Pokémon.

- **Type Filtering:** Implementing a dynamic button panel that enables users to filter Pokémon by type, providing a seamless and interactive experience.

- **Async/Await Usage:** Leveraging modern JavaScript practices, the codebase employs the `async/await` pattern for asynchronous operations, enhancing code readability and maintainability compared to traditional `then` chaining.

- **Custom Styling:** The project features a personalized design, including customized styles and images that contribute to a distinctive visual presentation of the Pokémon list.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structuring the content and layout of the web application.

- **CSS3:** Styling the user interface to provide an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design.

- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Implementing dynamic functionality, PokeAPI integration, and asynchronous operations using `async/await`.
